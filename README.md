# HackBeanpot-2017-Photo-Quest

This is our repository for the 2017 HackBeanpot Hackathon! We're creating a mobile game called Photo Quest.
It's like an "escape the room" type game, except to proceed you need to use items that can be added to your inventory by taking pictures of them in the real world. 
To identify objects from the camera, we're using indico's image API.
