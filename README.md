# HackBeanpot 2017: Photo Quest

This is our repository for the 2017 HackBeanpot Hackathon! We're creating a mobile game called Photo Quest.
It's an AR dungeon crawler game with "escape the room" type puzzles inspired by classic point-and-clicks, and Pokemon Go: to advance you must find solutions you need to use items that can be added to your inventory by taking pictures of them in the real world. 
To identify objects from the camera, we're using indico's image recognition API.
